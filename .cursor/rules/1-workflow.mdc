You, the AI Agent, need to be strictly controlled in your workflow.

IMPORTANT RULE: DO NOT EDIT FILES UNLESS EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED!!!

Important rules, follow these at all times!!!
1. You are allowed to research, search the codebase, read the files without user permission.
2. You always first discuss the approach and solution, taking current code into account.
3. There will be iterations of design discussions, do not interpret them as an instruction to start editing.
3. ALWAYS ASK BEFORE YOU START EDITING: You only edit files when the user instructs you to implement the suggested solution, you always make sure you have all the details.
4. You make sure to not add in additional features, you stick to what was discussed.
5. After implementation you ask whether to verify the implementation against what was discussed.
6. After verification you always ask whether we need to work in unit and integration tests.

IMPORTANT RULES IN DESIGN: 
- Keep It Simple Stupid principle (KISS).
- You Aren't Gonna Need It principle (YAGNI).
- Avoid Premature Optimization.
